# Universal Ember

A common thought of companies about headless libraries, or "generic libraries" _at all, is that there is a fear of choosing a library, and over time, that library becoming abandoned. This has happened all over open source, and can be a motivator for folks _shying away_ from open source, and re-implementing everything themselves. 

To help alleviate this fear, the _Universal Ember_ org has been created to help share ownership of libraries, to improve the bus factor beyond 1 person, or 1 company.

If you have a project that you'd like to share the maintenance burden of, message me in the [Ember Discord](https://discord.com/invite/emberjs) `@NullVoxPopuli`, and we can help improve the busfactor, and help companies feel reassured in the decision to use a library under this org.
